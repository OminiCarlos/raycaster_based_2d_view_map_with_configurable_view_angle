A 2D vision  map that shows the view of a player, using ray casting algorithm. 
- This map overcomes a issue that when the distance is long, there will be holes between rays.
Simple ray casting with angular step of 1 degree.

My algorithm converts converstional angluar-based iteration in polar coordinate into pixel-based iteration the edge. This way the iteration is angularly dynamic, and will not fail when the size of the map is big.

- The view angle of the player is configurable.
Player vision angle =  270 degree:

Under the hood, I used Breseham's algorithm, and developped my own algorithm to scan the field in the player's vision. 

This is a spin of the original repo.
The orginal repo uses polar coordinates to find points to check on the ray. However, because the picture is in Cartesian coordinate system, the coordinates need to be converted. Since the digital system have limited accuracy, some number could be truncated. This approach does not guarantee that every pixel on the ray is covered, leading to holes.

My version uses Bresenhamâ€™s Line Drawing Algorithm to cast the ray, which sweeps every grid on the main axis and finds the secondary coordinate. 
A important trick with this algorithm is that steep lines need to be handled differently. Steep lines have an increment on x axis is more than the y axis. This is the result if we renderlines without doing so.

When the line is steep, a step of x leads to more than one step on y. As a result, the line leaves holes on the y axis. 

To avoid this issue, we need to switch the x, y coordinates.  When the ray is "steep", we need to swap x with y. This way y becomes the main axis, and very y is covered. However, when saving the file and checking the hit map, the main axis used to locate the target pixel is still x axis. Therefore, when performing these tasks, x and y should be swapped back. 

A naive way is to swapped y and x literally. However, if we swap y and x, the primary axis is switched back to x. The main axis is wrong when entering the next loop. To fix the issue, another swap is required. 

``` cpp

    if(player_a >= (float) M_PI/4 && player_a <= (float) M_PI/2) // in octan 2, the line is steep
    {
        c_pri = py;  // primary axis is y, becasue each step of y incurrs delta x <1.
        o_pri = py;
        o_sec = px;  // specify the origin of the secondary axis
        lim_pri = win_h;
        steep = true;
    }

    for (; c_pri <= lim_pri; c_pri++) 
    {   
        double factor;
        steep?  factor = cos(player_a) / sin(player_a) : factor = tan(player_a);
        size_t c_sec = (c_pri - o_pri)  * factor + o_sec;

        if(steep) // first swap
        {
            int temp = c_pri;
            c_pri = c_sec;
            c_sec = temp;
        }

        if(hit_map[c_pri + c_sec * lim_pri] != ' ') break;
        framebuffer[c_pri + c_sec * lim_pri] = pack_color(255, 255, 255); // segfalut

        if(steep) // second swap
        {
            int temp = c_pri;
            c_pri = c_sec;
            c_sec = temp;
        }
    }
```

A smarter solution is when referencing the target pxiel, instead of referencing by (x,y), reference by (y,x). The values are swapped logically instead of physically.

``` cpp
    if(steep) // transpose back by switching x, y coordinates in the coordinate reference.
    {
        if(hit_map[c_sec + c_pri * lim_pri] != ' ') break;
        framebuffer[c_sec + c_pri * lim_pri] = pack_color(255, 255, 255);
    }
    else
    {
        if(hit_map[c_pri + c_sec * lim_pri] != ' ') break;
        framebuffer[c_pri + c_sec * lim_pri] = pack_color(255, 255, 255); 
    }   
```

Another challenge is that the code needs to be separate into 8 cases, corresponding to 8 octans:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04540181-d889-4851-9548-3222b37bb5e3)

This is because when the coordinates are negative, the increment needs to be negated. Since there are 2 axis in the Cartesian system, there are 4 cases. Considering we handle lines differently when it is steep, the loop would have 8 cases. 
|Octan | x | y | Steep |
|---|---|---|---|
|1 | + | + | false|
|2 | + | + | true|
|3 | - | + | true|
|4 | - | + | false|
|5 | - | - | false|
|6 | - | - | true|
|7 | + | - | true|
|8 | + | - | false|



But we don't want to write the code 8 times... What can we do to make the code more efficient?
The sign of x and y increment can be handled by sin(theta) and cos(theta). 
If the line is steep can be checked by comparing the absolute value of sin(theta) and cos(theta). 
Since when we transpose the coordinates, we swap x, y and their byproduct altogether. 
``` cpp

// step 1: calculate all the byproducts
    float dx = cos(player_a);
    float dy = sin(player_a);

    int stepx = (dx == 0) ? 0 : (dx < 0 ? -1 : 1);
    int stepy = (dy == 0) ? 0 : (dy < 0 ? -1 : 1);

    bool steep = false; // flag that idicates the data needs to be transposed.
    int lim_pri = win_w; // limit of the primary axis
    int c_x = px; // cast coordinate on primary axis;
    int c_y = py; // cast coordinate on secondary axis;
    float delta = abs(dy/dx);
// step 2: swap x, y when it's steep.
    if (abs(dy) > abs(dx)) 
    {
        steep = true;
        lim_pri = win_h;
        std::swap(c_x, c_y);
        std::swap(dx, dy);
        std::swap(stepx, stepy);
    }
// Step 3: sweep each pixel in the main axis.
    float sum_delta = 0;
    while (c_x <= lim_pri && c_x >= 0)
    {   
        // render first;
        if(steep) // transpose back by switching x, y coordinates in the coordinate reference.
        {
            if(hit_map[c_y + c_x * lim_pri] != ' ') break;
            framebuffer[c_y + c_x * lim_pri] = pack_color(255, 255, 255); // segfalut
        }
        else
        {
            if(hit_map[c_x + c_y * lim_pri] != ' ') break;
            framebuffer[c_x + c_y * lim_pri] = pack_color(255, 255, 255); // segfalut
        }

        // then figure out the next pixel.
        c_x += stepx;
        sum_delta += delta;
        if (sum_delta >= 0.5)
        {
            c_y++;
            sum_delta -= 1;
        }
    }
```
An issue I have is that when the angle = pi/2, the ray is casted upwards instead of downwards. After hard thought, I realized that the issue is with the precision. When theta = pi/2, cos(theta) is a very small negative number. We can't really manipulate the input to get it to zero, but have to ignore the error and set it to zero.

``` cpp
    float dx = cosf(player_a);
    if (fabs(dx) < 1e-7) {  // 1e-7 is an example threshold
        dx = 0.0f;
    }
```
At this point, we have a somewhat working code for ray casting. There are still a lot of issues with the code. At the moment, the players view is sweeped by casting a ray at each 1 degree. However, when the distance is big, the ray will leave gaps in between. The reason is again that the code is casting rays in polar coordinates.

After much work, I have refactored the code so that the entire function is based on Cartesian coordinates. 
There are a few challenges that arose with the Cartesian system. 
One fundermental issue lies under the inter-angle conversion. In polar system, when we iterate through the player's view, we iterate by a fixed angle. To make sure we can iterate through each pixel, we need to make sure the angular resolution is small enough. The bigger the angle of the pixel is to the player, the smaller the angular difference between the left and right edge of the pixel will be. In addition, since we transpose the x, y axis when the angle is more than 45 degree, the maximum angle of the pixel to the player will be 45 degree. To find out the minimum angular resolution, we need to find out the angular distance of one pixel at 45 degree. In this case, the angular step is fixed. 
On the other hand, when we transfer the coordinates in the Cartesian system, the function iterates through each pixel instead of the angle. Therefore, the angular difference are no more fixed. The advantage with the Cartisian system is that since each pxiel has integer coordinates, many calculation are much less comupte-heavy.To optimize the the operations in this Coordinate system, many logics needs to be changed.
In this system, I used math to calculate the interception of players gaze with the edge of the map, then set it as the imaginary destination, and cast a ray to it. However, the intersection with the map can be tricky. It can hit on the vertical and horizontal edges, depending on player's state. In addition, to avoid the loss of precision, we need to transpose x and y. The issue is further complicated when the known coordinate changes depending on the edge the ray cross with. For example, When it's the upper edge, y = 0, we need to calculate x. When it's the right edge, x = window_width, we need to calculate y. 
In addition, since we are iterating all points on the edge, the way to iterate edges are also subtle. First we need to find out which points are visible; Then we need to know when to iterate horizontally and vertically...
I will update this introduction in the future.

Finally, I have noticed that even this solution is not optimal. This solution is compute heavy since I cast a ray to every pxiel. It might be easier to just cast a ray to check the potential corners of the blocks. Once all the blocks are checked the field between 2 rays, which is a triangle, should be visible. Instead of casting a ray, I can simply render the triangles. I will refactor my program further.
